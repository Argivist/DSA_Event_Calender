# Event Scheduler and Calendar - DSA Project

This project aims to create an efficient Event Scheduler and Calendar system using various data structures and algorithms to manage events seamlessly. It encompasses functionalities such as event reminders, time conflict resolution, creation, modification, monthly view, and daily view.

## Features

- **Event Reminders:** Set reminders for upcoming events using priority queues.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Resolve overlapping schedules efficiently using Proirity queues.
- **Event Creation and Modification:** Add and modify events with optimal algorithms.
- **Monthly and Daily View:** View events organized by month or day.

## Data Structures Used

- **Arrays:** Linear storage for events, quick access by index.
- **Hash Tables:** Fast retrieval of events based on keys like event IDs or dates.
- **Priority Queues:** Efficient handling of event reminders and sorting by priority.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Event Reminders:** Utilizes priority queues for managing and triggering reminders (Time Complexity: O(log n)).
- **Event Conflicts:** Resolves conflicts in schedules employing divide-and-conquer strategies (Time Complexity: O(n log n)).
- **Event Creation and Modification:** Efficient insertion and modification techniques using hash tables or arrays (Time Complexity: O(1) or O(n)).
- **Monthly and Daily View:** Algorithms designed to display events for a specific day or month (Time Complexity: O(n) or O(1)).

## Usage

### Installation

No specific installation is required. Simply download the repository and run the `App.java` code in a compatible environment.
